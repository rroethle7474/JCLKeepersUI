This project uses the PlayerAPI ([text](https://github.com/rroethle7474/PlayerApi)) to retrieve stats for the determining allowable keepers.

Also this project and the [text](https://github.com/rroethle7474/JCL2025-Roster) repo will be tied together eventually to create one app to load in keepers each year for our fantasy baseball league.
